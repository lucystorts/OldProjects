Hello! My name is Lucy Storts and I am a senior studying statistics at BYU. I took at statistics class in high school and was fascinated by all the different fields statistics can be applicatied to. Now, my studies focus on data science and I hope to be able to work with data of all kinds.

Some of my interests outside of school and work include hiking, traveling, beading jewelry, and playing with my dog, Benson. He lives with my parents while I am in school, but I am excited to be reunited once I graduate.

Some of my professional interests include epidemiological data, climate change, women's health, healthcare data, bioinformatics, and application of machine learning to the study of genetics. I believe the "hard-to-answer" questions can be answered through data collection and analysis, and I am excited to share and apply what I've been studying to real world problems. 

Finally, I wanted to thank you for checking out my blog! Just for fun, here are a couple pictures I took this summer while hiking at Glacier NP...
